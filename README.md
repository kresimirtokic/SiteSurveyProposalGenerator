This is a little Java app that I created to automate and simply my life as an AV systems designer and engineer. It prompts the user for basic project and system information as well as room dimensions to determine appropriately sized TVs and speaker quantities and populates a bill of materials Excel file based upon a scalable system design I engineered for conference room AV systems.
